The Soft Circuits app is the first digital project released as part of an ongoing collaboration with Bristol based audio company Soft Circuits. It is currently under development!
    
The landing page was designed to promote the upcoming release of 'Polymorph', a granular synthesiser engine developed for the Roli Seaboard and with an accompanying Kontact library.
    
The main page filters between 2 GLSL liquid shaders created using Three.JS and allows full mobile and desktop interactivity. The app is also audio-reactive, dynamically effecting the volume of 4 voices using the screen as an XY controller. Front-end for the app is built using React, and includes layered IFrames running three.JS scripts remotely. The audio processing and effects chain are handled by Howler and Tuna.JS. After a timeout, users can navigate to a mailing list which will dynamically connect to MailChimp.
